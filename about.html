            <p>Hello! I'm Jonathan Ryan, a passionate GIS Specialist with over 8 years of experience in geospatial data management,
                spatial analysis, GIS application development, and map creation. I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Geospatial Information
                Science and currently serve as a Management Analyst - GIS for the City of Norfolk. With a strong foundation in both the
                public sector and military, I’ve developed a well-rounded skill set that includes creating interactive GIS applications,
                conducting complex spatial analyses, and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to solve real-world problems.</p>
            <p>Throughout my career, I have worked with a variety of stakeholders, from city planners to military leaders, and have
                applied GIS technology to enhance decision-making and streamline workflows. In my current role, I develop GIS
                solutions that support planning, zoning, and permit management efforts, while also contributing to public engagement
                projects using tools like ESRI Experience Builder and Survey 123 Connect. I've also implemented Python workflows to
                automate data tasks, improving efficiency and ensuring more timely access to important datasets. </p>
            <p>Prior to my work in local government, I served as a Geospatial Intelligence Workflow Coordinator in the U.S. Air Force,
                where I led the creation of forensic imagery products and managed complex geospatial projects for national and
                international stakeholders. My team’s work played a key role in strategic decision-making, and I also took pride
                in training and mentoring others in GIS and geospatial intelligence techniques.</p>
            <p>Outside of my career, I have gained valuable experience through freelance GIS work, collaborating with diverse
                teams to create tailored solutions that meet their unique needs. I am also committed to expanding my skill set
                in GIS, software development, and programming, continually seeking opportunities to enhance my knowledge surrounding
                these areas.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio to see examples of my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss
                potential collaborations or learn more about how I can contribute to your team!</p>
