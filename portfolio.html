            <div class="description-2">
                <p>In a coordinated effort between the current planning team and our comprehensive planning consultant team,
                    a report on all major current conditions was written. I was tasked with compiling the findings into a website-like
                    format. I chose to create several Story Maps and compile them into a collection. One limitation we face when creating
                    web-based applications for the city is that they must be able to be embedded directly into the cityâ€™s
                    website, rather than creating a separate web page. Story Map was selected because of its ease of embedding into a web page.</p>

                    <p>During the development of our new comprehensive plan, current planning identfied a need to gain input from residents who cannot
                        participate in an in person event. They tasked me to create a survey that would allow residents to place multiple points on a
                        map and afterwards populate a map with the results. Above is a story map that details the creation of the applications for this
                        project.

        <div class="brief-text">
            <p>Attached is the python code I wrote for a final project in my SDS 510 Data Wrangling course. The aim of the
                project was to use multiple data sources and combine them into a single one and then run a statistical analysis on the
                combined dataset. The Project used BeautifulSoup for web scraping,
                Dash for dashboard creation, and pandas/numpy for statistical analysis </p>
